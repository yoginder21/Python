Data Categorization

When working with data in a business context, it's essential to categorize each data field based on its segmentation parameter type. The data fields are categorized as "Demographic," "Purchasing," "Behavioral," "Attitude," or "Other" as relevant.
Calculating Annual Spending on Electronics

In the Survey Data worksheet, a new column labeled "Annual spending on electronics" has been inserted to calculate the annual spending on electronics for each respondent. Another column labeled "Spending as % of income" has been added to calculate annual spending on electronics as a percentage of annual income.
Creating Tables for Attribute Analysis

Tables have been created for each attribute, such as Gender, to record the percentage of responses for each answer. This provides insights into the distribution of responses for each attribute.
Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix has been generated for the dataset to identify relationships between variables. Relationships between variables such as Age vs. Purchasing Frequency, Age vs. TV Viewing, Annual Income vs. TV Viewing, Monthly Electronic Spending vs Monthly Household Spending, and more are analyzed and described.
Answering Key Questions

Key questions have been addressed through data analysis:

    How many married men who are early adopters can afford to purchase a TiVo for $499 while maintaining high electronics spending?
    How many educated women make electronics purchasing decisions without discussing with a spouse?
    How many early adopters purchase electronics yearly from electronics-specialized stores?
    How many seniors spend over six hours a day watching TV? What's their income range and average annual income?

Groupby Analysis
